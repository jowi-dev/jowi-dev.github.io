    <h1>Control Flow</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
As mentioned in the previous post on <a href="link">functions</a>, control flow is where we first start to really feel the difference of thinking elixir vs a C-Style language. Elixir’s control flow can be broken into 5 concepts: <code class="inline">if</code>, <code class="inline">with</code>, <code class="inline">case</code>,  <code class="inline">cond</code>, and as a more general concept, pattern matching.</p>
<h2>
If/else/unless</h2>
<p>
If statements are pretty much as you’d expect, with a few notable differences</p>
<pre><code class="typescript">let num = 2;
if (num === 2){
  console.log(&quot;2&quot;);
} else {
  console.log(&quot;Not 2&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="elixir">num = 2
if num == 2 do
  IO.puts&quot;2&quot;
else
  IO.puts&quot;Not 2&quot;
end</code></pre>
<p>
If/do  and else/end replace brackets for wrapping control.</p>
<h3>
Bonus: Ternary</h3>
<p>
One thing I (ab)used in TypeScript was the use of the ternary operator. Elixir has its own form.</p>
<pre><code class="TypeScript">let sheWalkedAwayFromMe = true;
let age = sheWalkedAwayFromMe ? 23 : 21;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="elixir">she_walked_away_from_me = true
age = if she_walked_away_from_me, do: 23, else: 21</code></pre>
<p>
If statements, as well as all control flow statements can be used in assignments. For example, we could write the ternary from above in expanded form</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">she_walked_away_from_me = true
age = 
  if she_walked_away_from_me do 
    23
  else
    21
  end</code></pre>
<p>
and <code class="inline">age</code> would be 23. It was hard to wrap my head around that at first, but you’ll find it very useful in some situations.</p>

with</h2>
<p>
With statements… what the hell are they even for really? </p>

Pattern Matching</h2>

case</h2>
